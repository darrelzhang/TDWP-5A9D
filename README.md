# TDWP-5A9D
a parallel algorithm for high-dimensional quantum dynamics  simulations in poly-atomic reactions

This file contains three programs: the bound state calculation of YNZ2 molecules ("bound"), the scattering potential energy surface calculation for the X+YNZ2 reaction ("pes_cal"), and the time-dependent wave packet dynamics calculation for the X+YNZ2 reaction ("scatt"). For specific usage instructions, please refer to the README file in each folder.
