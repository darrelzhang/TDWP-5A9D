# TDWP-5A9D
a parallel algorithm for high-dimensional quantum dynamics  simulations in poly-atomic reactions

The parallelization strategy for wavepacket dynamics calculations studying polyatomic reactions is given in the program mpi_potent.f and mpi_scatt.f.

# Requirements
Linux OS

Intel fortran compiler (2015 or later)

openmpi-1.4.5 (or later)

*We carried out calculations on one of our in-house computer clusters. The cluster comprises 30 shared-memory computer nodes, each with 20 Intel Xeon E5-2640 v4 processors (CPU cores) at 2.40 GHz and 256 gigabytes (GB) of main memory. The operating system running on the nodes is CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511 with the 3.10.0-327.el7.x86_64 kernel. Each node is equipped with one Infiniband Host Channel Adapter (HCA) supporting 4x Quad Data Rate (QDR) connections with a 40 GB/second speed. We have one 4x-QDR Infiniband connection from each node to a central Infiniband switch (Mellanox, MT26428). The TDWP-5A9D program was compiled at the -O2 optimization level with OpenMP support using the Intel Fortran compiler (version 15.0.2). The MPI utilities implemented as in Open MPI 34 (version 1.4.5) were adopted.*


# compile
One should modify the variable MKL_PATH in the makefile and then

make

# run

mpirun -hostfile machinefile -n  procs  ./xynh2.exe

machinefileï¼š contains the hostname of the parallel computing nodes

procs: number of MPI processes

The input file for the program is given as "input" in default.
All of the output files are in "result" directory.
